# Sleepy time iPhone web app

This tool is an iPhone web app version of David Shaw's sleepyti.me site.

The primary reason for making a mobile app is to allow the site to be fully cached so it can be used without an internet connection.

The iphone version may be found here: http://billiamram.com/sleepyti.me
